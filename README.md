## CPP Piscine - 42 Cursus. 
#####It is a list of projects focussed in C++, it is the first exercise of the 42 Cursus which introduce to the students into the C++ language. During nine different subjects we must work in 35 different exercises to get the fundamentals of C++ and Object Oriented Programming. For more information abut which exercises are included and waht we learn in each module, you can access to the subject of each one.
