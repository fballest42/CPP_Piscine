# CPP PISCINE

### CPP Piscine into the common core of 42 Cursus. 

It is a list of projects focussed in C++, it is the first exercise of the 42 Cursus which introduce to the students into the C++ language. During nine different subjects we must work in 35 different exercises to get the fundamentals of C++ and Object Oriented Programming.

#####CPP MODULE 00:
This first module of C++ is designed to help you understand the specifities of the language when compared to C. Time to dive into Object Oriented Programming!. More info [here](cpp00/Readme.md).

#####CPP MODULE 01:
This module is designed to help you understand the memory allocation, reference, pointers to members and the usage of the switch in CPP. More info [here](cpp01/Readme.md).
